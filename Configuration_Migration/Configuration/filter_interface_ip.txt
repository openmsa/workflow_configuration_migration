# This file filter_interface_ip.txt contains the list of element to filter based on the interface subnet and other.
#
# Source Microservice Name|source variable name IP|source variable name mask|destination Microservice Name|destination variable name
# The order is important, When the "destination Microservice Name" is the same on 2 or more following lines, it will cumulated all source IP before to run the filter on the "destination Microservice Name" MS.
